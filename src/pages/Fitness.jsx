    title: "Weight Loss Myths You Need to Stop Believing",
    description:
      "Many misconceptions about weight loss prevent people from achieving sustainable results. Carbs donâ€™t necessarily cause weight gain; in fact, the right type of carbs fuels workouts. Skipping meals slows down metabolism instead of aiding weight loss. Fat-free foods are often high in sugar and not always the healthier option. Sweating does not equal fat loss; real progress comes from consistent exercise and a balanced diet. Understanding these facts can help you make smarter choices on your weight loss journey.",
